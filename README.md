# M5G1

I had no idea what to do with this project so I googled around and found that a lot of MERN tutorials do a to-do app. So that's what I did!
So on this web app you can create tasks, mark them as complete and delete them. 
I made this before the group project started, even though I'm turning it in late (had to figure out some errors that kept crashing my server), and I would probably do some things differently now that I understand this a little better ;) 

I tried to leave some comments in the code to explain what I am doing but I admit that I'm kind of bad at explaining code. Tried my best!
